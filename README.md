## island_spawn
### a mod for the game factorio


This mod adds recipes to build everything from a small Island surrounded by water.

When generating a new world you will land on a lone island with a chest that contains basic ressources.

The idea is to generate everything from wood and water like the skyblock game for minecraft (which inspired this mod).
Currently there are some unbalanced recipes that need tweaking, but overall everything should work.
